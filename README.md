**It's Metasploit, but fake.**


For my day-job we put on a lot of hacking demonstrations and want to let the audience members participate. One exercise is meant to have the participant use Metasploit and hack a real Windows target... but sometimes, setting up multiple Windows is _a pain_.

So, I had a crazy thought: "let's fake it."

This project aims to recreate the "look-and-feel" of Metasploit and interacting the command-line program, but without actually having a real target to attack. _It's all just for show._

# This is a WORK IN PROGRESS
